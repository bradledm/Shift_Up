		<li>What is Lorem Ipsum?</li>
		<p>
		Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
		Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

<div id=questions>
	<ul>
		<li>What are you looking to get out of this program and why?</li>
			<p>I am looking to increase my knowledge in Web Development/Coding in order to learn new skillsets.  I have made many attempts at learning different programming          languages but always seem to hit the same roadblocks:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Never can make time with a busy schedule</li>
                <li>Unable to learn the language in on-the-job</li>
                <li>Not interested in going back to college to take a bunch of courses that will only scratch the surface on the things I want to learn</li>
            </ul>
            
		<li>Why are you a good fit for this program?</li>
			<p>I come from many years of experience in IT from the Automotive Industry.  I achieved my Bachelor's degree from Walsh College back in 2003 and have been working in IT ever since.  I feel I'm a great fit for this program because of what I can contribute with my years of experience.
            <ul>
                <li>I worked for over five years as a self taught Linus administrator using RedHat based distros.</li>
                <li>I support GM OnStar's Software deveopment in an Agile methodology</li>
                <li>I have built my own LAMP stack web server running Drupal.</li>
